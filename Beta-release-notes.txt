This build will install on parallel to the App Store version of ZotPad. 

This build has not been tested extensively and is most likely not stable enough. There are a lot of internal changes, which make the code more robust and efficient, but also could have introduced new bugs.

There is no need to report crashes. If you find that something is not working (but does not cause a crash) or is slow, you should report that. See the instructions here:

If you are installing this over an existing beta, you should reset your data before running the App.

More beta testers can be admitted

New features and notable changes since ZotPad 1.1.2

GENERAL:

Feature: Recursive collections

- Enabled in the advanced settings
- Recurses only collections that have been cached. This is a technical limitation because Zotero server does not support recursive collections. In practice, because collection memberships are cached aggressively, this feature should "just work".

Feature: Tag selector
- Pulled or tapped open over the libraries and collections list
- There are two ideas related to tags that may be implemented in the 1.2 version. Check these pages and vote the ideas up if you want them implemented:

Change: In-app contact support 
- The email support has been removed and replaced with UserVoice provided alternative
- In-app support feature now suggests knowledge base articles from UserVoice

Change: Citations are now formatted by ZotPad instead of Zotero server
- ZotPad uses formatted citations in the item list and when emailing items from the App. These were previously retrieved from Zotero server, but are now generated by ZotPad when needed. 
- Makes item retrieving about twice as fast and reduces time outs
- The citation processor is still incomplete. Of you notice errors, enable the "Debug citation processor" feature in the advanced settings, view the item that was not formatted correctly, and submit a support request from the App. 

IPAD SPECIFIC:

Feature: Layered navigation
- Enables navigating libraries and collections "as a stack of cards" instead of as separate view
- Disabled by default and can be enabled in the advanced settings

Feature: Unified navigation
- Removes the small, blue detail disclosure button from the library and collections list. Tapping a collection will both show the subcollections and items for that collection. (You should probably have layered navigation selected as well)
- Disabled by default and can be enabled in the advanced settings

IPHONE SPECIFIC:

Feature: Layered navigation
- Enables navigating libraries and collections "as a stack of cards" instead of as separate view
- Enabled by default and cannot be disabled.

Feature: Cache status pane
- The cache status pane that is show below the library and collections list on iPad has been added in the iPhone version.
