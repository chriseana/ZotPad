This is a release candidate build with no known bugs or missing features.

THIS BUILD WILL INSTALL OVER THE APP STORE VERSION OF ZOTPAD AND UPGRADE IT TO 1.2

If you install this build and want to revert to 1.1 version, you need to uninstall ZotPad and reinstall it from the App Store

----- Changes since the previous beta build -----

GENERAL: 

- Fixes bug
- Updated the user manuals to reflect changes in 1.2
- Added an upgrade script to upgrade from 1.1 to 1.2

----- Other new features and notable changes since ZotPad 1.1.2 ------

GENERAL:

Feature: Printing articles
- Accessed through the action menu in item detail view or item viewer

Feature: Lookup
- Accessed through the action menu in item detail view
- Supports the same lookup engines that come with Zotero: crossref, library lookup, pubget, google scholar
- View items in the online Zotero library (Can be useful for troubleshooting.)

Feature: Note viewing and editing
- Notes are now shown in the item detail view and can be edited by tapping

Feature: Tag viewing and editing
- Tags are now shown in the item detail view and can be edited by tapping

Feature: New file viewer
- The file viewer has a collapsible side panel that can be used to view and edit tags and notes for the parent item and the attachment.
- Fast switching between previously viewed items by using history arrows
- The top bar is always visible and this cannot be changed. (This is a technical limitation and there is no practical fix for it.)

Feature: Mark items as favorites
- Added a star button that can be used to mark items as favorites

Feature: Added more help popovers to help new users to discover the features of the App

Feature: Recursive collections

- Enabled in the advanced settings
- Recurses only collections that have been cached. This is a technical limitation because Zotero server does not support recursive collections. In practice, because collection memberships are cached aggressively, this feature should "just work".

Feature: Tag selector
- Pulled or tapped open over the libraries and collections list
- There are two ideas related to tags that may be implemented in the 1.2 version. Check these pages and vote the ideas up if you want them implemented:

Change: In-app contact support 
- The email support has been removed and replaced with UserVoice provided alternative
- In-app support feature now suggests knowledge base articles from UserVoice

Change: Citations are now formatted by ZotPad instead of Zotero server
- ZotPad uses formatted citations in the item list and when emailing items from the App. These were previously retrieved from Zotero server, but are now generated by ZotPad when needed. 
- Makes item retrieving about twice as fast and reduces time outs
- The citation processor is still incomplete. Of you notice errors, enable the "Debug citation processor" feature in the advanced settings, view the item that was not formatted correctly, and submit a support request from the App. 

Feature: Layered navigation
- Enables navigating libraries and collections "as a stack of cards" instead of as separate view
- Replaces the old collection navigation logic

IPAD SPECIFIC:

Feature: Unified navigation
- Removes the small, blue detail disclosure button from the library and collections list. Tapping a collection will both show the subcollections and items for that collection.
- Disabled by default and can be enabled in the advanced settings

IPHONE SPECIFIC:

Feature: Cache status pane
- The cache status pane that is show below the library and collections list on iPad has been added in the iPhone version.
