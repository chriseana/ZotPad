Zotero and Dropbox need to be linked with a symbolic link. The scripts included
in this folder will setup the linking.

WINDOWS: 

Double click on the file "link_zotero_windows.vbs"

MAC and LINUX/UNIX:

Give the file "link_zotero_mac_unix.sh" execute permissions and run it.

On Mac, the execute permissions are set with the Terminal.app. Lauch
Terminal.app, and type "chmod a+x " without the quotes, with the trailing space,
and without pressing enter. Then drag the file "link_zotero_mac_unix.sh" into 
the terminal window and press enter. After this, you can run the script by
double clicking it or by dragging it into Terminal.pp and pressing enter.

If you decide to discontinue using ZotPad with Dropbox, you can remove the link
by deleting the Apps/ZotPad folder.
