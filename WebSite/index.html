<h1>ZotPad</h1>
<h2>Introduction and features</h2>
<p>ZotPad is an iPad client for Zotero reference management system. The main purpose of the software is
to enable reading PDF files that stored on the Zotero server. ZotPad stores the data and
files that it downloads from the Zotero server in a local cache enabling online and offline use.
In contrast to Zotero desktop software that maintains an offline copy of Zotero database that needs
to be syncronized periodically, ZotPad uses a continuos synchronization model. What this means that
as long as network connection is available, ZotPad will be connected to Zotero server and use the
data that is available on the server directly without the need for synchronization. ZotPad uses
a preemptive cache model that tries to predict what items the user will want to view and
downloads data and attachment files for these items in the background before the user has viewed
the items.</p>

<h2>Using ZotPad</h2>
<h3>First launch</h3>
<p>When ZotPad is launched the first time, it will first ask the user to sign in with their Zotero
user account and create a private key that ZotPad will use when communicating with the Zotero server.
ZotPad will not store your username or password, but will use this key instead. 
Choosing "Accept defaults" will allow ZotPad to connect to your personal library, but not group libraries.
The key can be later edited or canceled by visiting <a href="https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys">
https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys</a></p>

<h3>Navigating libraries and collections</h3
<p>After ZotPad has authenticated with Zotero server, it will display the main screen consisting
of navigator displaying the list of libraries you have access to and the main content area that
is initially empty. You can coose a library by tapping it or view the collections in a library
by tapping a detail disclosure button on the right side of the library name.</p>
<p>When you have chosen a library or a collection inside library by tapping it, ZotPad will
display a list of items in that collection. If a library or collection is found in the cache, it
will be displayed instantly. Otherwise the items are displayed as soon sa they have been downloaded
from the server. If cache is outdated, the items are first loaded from cache and then updated
with data from the server.<p>
<p>If an item has attachments that have already been
downloaded, a thumbnail of the first attachment is shown on the left side item. Currently thumbnails 
are supported only for PDF files. Tapping on a thumbnail will open that attachment in reading mode
and tapping on the item name or details will open the item in item details view.<p>
<p>The buttons in the bottom bar can be used to sort the item list and search bar can be used
for searching items from the currently shown item list. In the first version, the search 
functionality supports basic searches using the item details. Searching using attachment details
(e.g. attachment file name) or full text is not supported in the first version of ZotPad.
Searching for phrases ("this is a phrase") or logical operators (AND, OR) are not supported in the
first version of ZotPad.<p>

<p>ZotPad supports both landscape and portrait device orientation. If you turn the device into
portrait orientation, the navigator will disappear and the main content area will occupy the
full screeen. Navigator can be accessed with a button on the left side of the top bar.</p>

<h3>Viewing item details</h3>
<p>When an item is tapped in the item list, the item details are loaded in the main content area
and the item list is moved to the navigator so that you can quickly change to another item. The item
detail view shows a large thumbnail image for the attachment. Thumbnails are supported only for 
PDF attachments that have already been downloaded. Non-PDF files and files that have not yet been
downloaded are represented with document type images and text summary. Tapping an attachment
thumbnail will open the attachment in reading mode.</p>

<p>Item details are shown below the attachment and can be pulled up by scrolling down.</p>

<p>If an item has multiple attachments, these are displayed in a cover flow.</p>

<h3>Reading mode</h3>
<p>Reading mode shows one attachment in full screen view with a list of page thumbnails on the side.
If the item has multiple attachments, swiping sideways will switch between attachment files.</p>

<p>The action button on the right side of the top bar can be used to print the currently viewed
attachment or send it to other application that supports the file type (e.g. PDF files can be
sent to iAnnotate or GoodReader.)</p>

<h3>Adjusting preferences</h3>
<p>ZotPad has a preferences screen that is available through the Settings application. The first
section of preferences shows the current username. This can be changed by resetting the application,
after which the application will start with a login screen the next time it is started.<p>
<p>Mode has three different options:
<ul>
<li>Online, no cache - ZotPad will not store anything in or read anythign from cache, but only use
data from the server.</li>
<li>Online, with cache (default) - ZotPad will use cache to speed up showing items and to concerve
bandwidth, but will always check for up to data data from the server.</li>
<li>Offline - ZotPad shows only items from the cache and does not use internet connection.</li>
</ul>
There are probably very few instances when this setting should be changed.</p>
<p>Current cache size shows an approximation of how much space the cache is currently using. Max 
cache size sets the maximum size of a cache. This is not a strict limit, but can be exceeded 
temporarily until next cache cleanup takes place. The content of the cache can be viewed using
iTunes file upload and download.</p>
<p>The second section has two preferences for controlling the preemptive cache. The first setting
controls background downloading of item data. The choices are:
<ul>
<li>Off - No preemptive cache of items</li>
<li>Active collections (default) - ZotPad will cache item data from all collections that a user has
viewed.</li>
<li>Active libraries - ZotPad will cache item data from all collections in all libraries that a user
has viewed.</li>
<li>All libraries - ZotPad will cache all data available from the Zotero server.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The second setting controls background downloading of attachment files. The choices are:
<ul>
<li>Off - No preemptive cache of iattachment files</li>
<li>Active items (default) - ZotPad will cache attachments for files that have been viewed in item
detail view.</li>
<li>Active collections - ZotPad will cache attachments for files from all collections that a user
has viewed.</li>
<li>Active libraries - ZotPad will cache attachments for files from all collections in all libraries
that a user
has viewed.</li>
<li>All libraries - ZotPad will cache all attachment files available from the Zotero server.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The last section contain three options for resetting ZotPad. These will take effect the next time
the application is launched.</p>
